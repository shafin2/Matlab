# Geometric Spatial Transmission

Geometric Spatial Transmission is a versatile tool comprised of two essential components:

1. **Mapping Function**: This component maps coordinates from one space to another.
   
2. **Interpolation Function**: Responsible for interpolating values between given points to generate smooth transitions.

### Types of Transformations:

1. **Scaling**: 
   - Transforming coordinates by a scalar factor.
   - Formula:
     ```
     x' = scale_factor * x
     y' = scale_factor * y
     ```
   
2. **Translation**: 
   - Shifting coordinates by a constant value.
   - Formula:
     ```
     x' = x + dx
     y' = y + dy
     ```
   
3. **Shear**: 
   - Skewing coordinates along one axis.
   - Formula:
     ```
     x' = x + shear_factor * y
     y' = y + shear_factor * x
     ```
   
These transformations can be combined linearly:
```
x' = a0 * x + a1 * y + a2
y' = b0 * x + b1 * y + b2
```
In matrix form:
```
[x' ; y' ; 1] = [a0 a1 a2 ; b0 b1 b2 ; 0 0 1] * [x ; y ; 1]
```

Additionally, **Rotation** is another fundamental transformation:
- Rotation Matrix:
  ```
  [cos(theta)  -sin(theta)]
  [sin(theta)  cos(theta)]
  ```

### Implementation:

By adjusting the values of constants, you can easily manipulate images using the provided code. The following are sample results:

- If `a0` and `a2` are both set to 0:
